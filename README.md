## Overview
EasycPanel is the ultimate, free, one-click solution for installing, configuring, optimizing, and securing cPanel servers. Perfect for both novice and experienced system administrators, this powerful script handles everything from initial setup to performance tuning and security hardening.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL NOTICE FOR HETZNER SERVERS**

**üö® IMPORTANT: Before installing EasycPanel on Hetzner servers, you MUST set up all disks first!**

Hetzner servers have a known issue where additional disks are not automatically mounted during OS installation. **This MUST be done before running EasycPanel to avoid data loss and ensure optimal server performance.**

### **Required Steps for Hetzner Servers:**

1. **Detect all available disks**: `lsblk` or `fdisk -l`
2. **Mount ALL available disks** before installation
3. **Set up RAID/LVM configuration** if needed
4. **Verify disk setup**: Ensure all disks are properly mounted

### **Quick Hetzner Disk Setup:**
```bash
# Download and run our Hetzner disk setup script FIRST
curl -O https://saudhezam.com/cpanel-script/hetzner-disk-setup.sh && chmod +x hetzner-disk-setup.sh && ./hetzner-disk-setup.sh
```

**Why this is critical:**
- **Data Protection**: Prevents data loss during setup
- **Performance**: Utilizes all available disk space
- **Cost Efficiency**: You're paying for all disks, use them all!
- **Prevents Issues**: Avoids complex disk management later

**‚ùå DO NOT proceed with EasycPanel installation until ALL disks are properly set up!**
