# üö® CRITICAL WARNING FOR HETZNER SERVERS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP! READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING!**

### **MANDATORY DISK SETUP REQUIRED**

If you're using a **Hetzner dedicated server**, you **MUST** configure all disks before installing EasycPanel or any cPanel-related software.

---

## ‚ùå **THE PROBLEM**

**Hetzner servers have a critical issue:**
- Additional disks are **NOT automatically mounted** during OS installation
- Only the primary disk (usually `/dev/sda`) is configured
- Additional disks (like `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc.) remain **unformatted and unmounted**
- This affects **ALL** Hetzner dedicated servers regardless of the plan

---

## üí• **CONSEQUENCES OF IGNORING THIS**

### **Data Loss Scenarios:**
- Files saved to unmounted disks **disappear** on reboot
- Database files might be written to unmounted disks
- Backup files stored on unmounted disks are **lost**
- cPanel accounts created on unmounted disks become **inaccessible**

### **Performance Issues:**
- Server uses only 20-50% of available disk space
- Poor I/O performance due to single disk usage
- Unnecessary disk space wastage
- Higher hosting costs per GB used

### **Recovery Complexity:**
- Very difficult to migrate data after cPanel installation
- Requires service downtime for proper disk setup
- Potential for configuration conflicts
- Risk of data corruption during recovery

---

## ‚úÖ **THE SOLUTION**

### **1. Automatic Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download and run our Hetzner disk setup script
curl -O https://saudhezam.com/cpanel-script/hetzner-disk-setup.sh
chmod +x hetzner-disk-setup.sh
./hetzner-disk-setup.sh
```

### **2. Manual Verification**
Before proceeding, verify all disks are mounted:
```bash
# Check all available disks
lsblk

# Verify disk usage
df -h

# Check mount points
mount | grep -E '^/dev'
```

### **3. Safe Installation**
Only after disk setup is complete:
```bash
# Now safe to install EasycPanel
curl -O https://saudhezam.com/cpanel-script/cPanel-v4.sh
chmod +x cPanel-v4.sh
./cPanel-v4.sh
```

## üîç **IDENTIFYING UNMOUNTED DISKS**

### **Signs of Unmounted Disks:**
```bash
# If you see disks without mount points:
$ lsblk
NAME   SIZE TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda    480G disk 
‚îú‚îÄsda1   1G part /boot
‚îú‚îÄsda2   8G part [SWAP]
‚îî‚îÄsda3 471G part /
sdb    960G disk              # ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT MOUNTED!
sdc    960G disk              # ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT MOUNTED!
```

### **What You Should See After Setup:**
```bash
$ lsblk
NAME   SIZE TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda    480G disk 
‚îú‚îÄsda1   1G part /boot
‚îú‚îÄsda2   8G part [SWAP]
‚îî‚îÄsda3 471G part /
sdb    960G disk 
‚îî‚îÄsdb1 960G part /var        # ‚úÖ PROPERLY MOUNTED
sdc    960G disk 
‚îî‚îÄsdc1 960G part /home       # ‚úÖ PROPERLY MOUNTED
```
